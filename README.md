yeah there are others called the same, just like there are plenty of rocks around

this lib is designed to enable you to have nice D3-driven graphs in your HTML, without needing to JS all the things.
just write HTML attributes.

pull requests for more / better / exotic attributes welcome

NOTES:

- taking some inspiration from http://www.toptal.com/d3-js/towards-reusable-d3-js-charts as to a strategy for building reusable, configurable charts
- react components?
- demo page as being able to hook into datasets online, and draw graphs of them? not just CSV?
